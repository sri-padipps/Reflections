When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when done coding a piece of logic which can work well with the master code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- it might impact the current work I am doing in my local. It is safe to manually check the latest commits at hub and then decide whether to merge it with local

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork: to clone a repository within Github
- Clone: to clone a repository from Github to local or within local itself
- Branch: to create a new set of commits and give it a unique name

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- When local and Github versions differs, we can add Github version on top of last know remote commit and then give git diff to find the difference b/w local and Github versions
