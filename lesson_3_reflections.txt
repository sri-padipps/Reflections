When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when done coding a piece of logic which can work well with the master code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- it might impact the current work I am doing in my local. It is safe to manually check the latest commits at hub and then decide whether to merge it with local

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork: to clone a repository within Github
- Clone: to clone a repository from Github to local or within local itself
- Branch: to create a new set of commits and give it a unique name
