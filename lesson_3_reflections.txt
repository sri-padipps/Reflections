When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when done coding a piece of logic which can work well with the master code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- it might impact the current work I am doing in my local. It is safe to manually check the latest commits at hub and then decide whether to merge it with local
